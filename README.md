# my-first-github-project
Leaning Web Development
Hello from my development setup!
This is my first edit using Cursor and GitHub.
Testing my complete workflow.
Adding some new lines and committing, pushing to GitHub as another test.
Adding some lines directly to GitHub, then running the Pull function in cursor to testing pulling into local projects.
Now adding some lines and testing the fetch function.
